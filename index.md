# Rediscovering the Stories of Our World

We are passionate about this planet full of hidden stories, and we care deeply about the vibrant society we live in.

We are firm supporters and long-time contributors to open data—especially open map data. We're a team of seasoned veterans in cartography, navigation, and data science.

In today's noisy and restless AI era, we've chosen to start over—with a few small, meaningful creations.

## Our First Creation: StoryMapp

So far, we've launched just one product: **StoryMapp** (yes, with two "p"s).

Our hope is that it can help bring the countless stories scattered across the world to more people—so you can rediscover the wonder, the beauty, the awe, and sometimes, the sorrow of this world we share.
