# About Location Science GmbH

We are passionate about this planet full of hidden stories, and we care deeply about the vibrant society we live in.

Founded in Germany, Location Science GmbH brings together a team of seasoned veterans in cartography, navigation, and data science. We are firm supporters and long-time contributors to open dataâ€”especially open map data.

## Our Philosophy

In today's noisy and restless AI era, we've chosen to start overâ€”with a few small, meaningful creations.

We believe that technology should enhance human connection with the world around us, not overwhelm it. That's why we focus on creating thoughtful, purposeful applications that help people rediscover the wonder, beauty, awe, and sometimes the sorrow of this world we share.

## Our Product: StoryMapp
